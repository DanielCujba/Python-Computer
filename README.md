# Python Simulation of a Computer with VM Compiler and GUI
This project is a Python implementation of a computer based on the NAND2TETRIS course, with the addition of a VM Compiler and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The course teaches you how to build a modern computer from the ground up, starting with basic logic gates and progressing all the way to an operating system.

This project includes the implementation of all the necessary components, such as logic gates, adders, registers, memory, and CPU. Additionally, it includes a VM Compiler that can convert programs written in a high-level language (similar to Java JVM) into Hack assembly code, which can be run on the computer. Finally, the project includes a GUI that allows you to interact with the computer and run programs visually.

# Installation
To use this project, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to clone this repository to your computer:
```git clone https://github.com/username/nand2tetris-python```

# Usage
To use the computer simulation, you can run the GUI by running the following command:

```python gui.py```

The GUI will then open, and you can use it to interact with the computer. You can write programs in the high-level language supported by the VM Compiler, or you can write programs directly in Hack assembly language.

To run a program, you can load it from a file. Once you have loaded or written your program, you can compile it using the VM Compiler and then run it on the computer.
